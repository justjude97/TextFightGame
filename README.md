# TextFightGame
a toy project i'm coding. it is a simple text based exploration game where the user - acting as the player - moves around the map and collects items

the map is divided into rooms that the player progresses through

Unreal Engine 4 terminology is used in the code as i am currently getting used to the engine

classes:
player class - this class handles the players inventory- possibly in the future other things - it uses a vector of strings to store "items"
  //TODO replace strings with actual item class
  
map class - this class will handle map data including a description of the current room and any item objects that may be held there - maybe   in the future will contain enemy objects

item class - this class will handle item data including the name of the item, a description, and in the future possibly a list of effects


possible classes:

enemy class - a class that handles enemies for a possible combat module
